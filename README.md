## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+)
- PostgreSQL database

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/monteina-management.git
   cd monteina-management
   ```

2. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:
   ```bash
   # Frontend
   cd client
   npm install

   # Backend
   cd ../server
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up the database:
   - Create a `.env` file in the `server/` directory with the following.
    - Local:
      ```
      PORT=your_port
      NODE_ENV=development

      DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database>
      JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key

      EMAIL_USER=your_email_user
      EMAIL_PASS=your_email_pass

      CARQUERY_API_URL=your_car_query_api_url
      ```

    - Production:
      - Everything stays the same as in local development only `NODE_ENV` changes and addition of `VITE_BACKEND_URL` is needed:
      
        ```
        NODE_ENV=production
        VITE_BACKEND_URL=your_backend_url
        ```

   - Run Prisma migrations:
     ```bash
     npx prisma migrate dev --name init
     ```

4. Start the development servers:
   ```bash
   # Frontend
   cd client
   npm run dev

   # Backend
   cd ../server
   npm run dev
   ```
